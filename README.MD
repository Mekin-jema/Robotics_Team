## Project Overview

This project aims to:

1. Build and optimize the VEX V5 robot for competitions.
2. Implement efficient and reliable subsystems for driving, manipulating, and autonomous functionality.
3. Use modern programming practices to ensure modular, scalable, and maintainable code.

## Branch Organization

The repository is divided into feature branches based on robot subsystems and functionalities. Each branch focuses on a specific aspect of the robot, ensuring clear responsibilities and minimizing conflicts during development.

### Feature Branches:

1. `feature/drive-system`: Development of the drivetrain (movement control).
2. `feature/manipulators`: Code for robot manipulators like arms, claws, or intakes.
3. `feature/sensors`: Integration and programming of VEX-compatible sensors.
4. `feature/autonomous`: Autonomous routines and path planning.
5. `feature/driver-control`: Customizable driver controls and user interface.
6. `feature/game-strategy`: Game-specific optimizations and strategies.
7. `feature/debugging`: Tools for debugging and performance diagnostics.
8. `feature/motor-management`: Power optimization and motor safety mechanisms.

## Development Workflow

Follow the steps below to ensure seamless collaboration:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<branch-name>
   ```

3. **Work on the Feature:**

   - Write code and commit changes locally.
   - Follow the branch-specific tasks outlined below.

4. **Push Changes:**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/<branch-name>
   ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**

   - Navigate to the GitHub repository and create a PR for merging your branch into the `develop` branch.
   - Assign reviewers and describe your changes.

6. **Code Review:**

   - Reviewers will provide feedback on the PR.
   - Address feedback and update the PR as needed.

7. **Merge and Test:**
   - After approval, the branch will be merged into `develop`.
   - Conduct integration testing to verify compatibility.
